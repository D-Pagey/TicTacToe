## Tic Tac Toe Game -  A Free Code Camp project

This is the 3rd of the "Advanced" projects in the old FreeCodeCamp curriculum. In
the initial vanilla JS version I learnt about how to code an "automated" computer 
player. In the React version, I learnt a lot about dealing with `setState`. The fact
that it is asynchronous presented an interesting challenge. 

There's a lot I'd like to improve about this project. I'm not super proud of the 
code but at this point in time I want to focus on more complex projects.

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
- [x] My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
- [x] I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

**Main Lessons Learnt:**
* Passing a reference to a function vs immediately executing
* Dealing with the async nature of `this.setState`
* Working with a bigger state object

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start`
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`
