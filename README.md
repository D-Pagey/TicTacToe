## Tic Tac Toe Game -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
- [ ] I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
- [ ] My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
- [x] I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

This is the 3rd Advanced Front End project for the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. I
wrote this app without using any libraries or frameworks, it is all native HTML,
 CSS and JavaScript.

The key thing I learnt on this project was how to write a automated player in
the game. Rather than write a game theory optimal opponent, I decided to simply
randomise the remaining options.

CodePen.
